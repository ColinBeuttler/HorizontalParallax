        <p> This Blog was designed for users to post current weather conditions within their area. I
            mostly
            worked
            on the blog form, connecting it to the backend and the UI. My favorite part of this site was our
            use of parallax. It was my first time I had ever used it and was the main reason I included it
            into my portfolio.

        <p>This app was designed to help users determine which restaurants around them they could dine
            in
            with their dogs. This was my first introduction to react.
            I was tasked with the tile puzzle and the backend of the login. I had not made any games with JavaScript,
            let alone React, but I was really pleased with the end. I hope to include other
            puzzle games such as this one in many future projects.
